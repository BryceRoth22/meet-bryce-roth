    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Harvey Rutherford</p>
    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 43</p>
    <p><strong>Profession or Role:</strong> Hiring manager looking for mid-level web developers.  </p>
    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Works remotely at times and has a company provided laptop with a docking station, <br>
        wireless keyboard/mouse and a second monitor.  Company provided equipment is at least a couple years old.  He <br>
        has an iPhone 14 Pro with the largest screen available.</p>
    <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Because of the busy days working to find potential candidates for <br>
    various job positions in the company and keeping up with family and friends, Harvey conducts as much business and <br>
    scheduling of work, family and friends on his iPhone.  He wants most (possibly all) his work and social interactions <br>
    to be done on his iPhone if it can't be done in person.  Harvey has several positions to fill and wants to be able <br>
    to quickly determine if a candidate will have the skills and attitude needed to do the job.</p>
    <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Frustrated that he is hiring web developers that will have newer, more <br>
        up-to-date equipment than him.  Harvey does not like to use the companies equipment since it is old and not <br>
        reliable.  Needs access to potential web developers and be able to quickly see that they have the necessary and <br>
        basic skills to be a mid-level web developer.</p>
    <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Finding and filling the mid-level web developer open positions quickly.  He will need to <br>
    determine if a candidate is worth moving forward with an interview or not in the least amount of time possible.  He <br>
    does not have time to dig around with each candidate to find the information he needs to make a decision.</p>
    <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a tech savvy hiring manager, I need to find qualified candidates for my open web <br>
    developer positions on my iPhone.</p>
